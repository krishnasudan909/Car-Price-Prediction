# CarPricePrediction
This is my first Machine learning Project which predicts the price of a used car, based on its features.
Here Static is the folder having the images and the java script files and you can also add css files into it.
in templates there is a index.html file.
app.py is the python flask file.
in checkpoints folder there is a python jupyter notebook file in which the model is trained.
car_data.csv is the dataset which i have got from kaggle.
I have used random forest regression in this model.
